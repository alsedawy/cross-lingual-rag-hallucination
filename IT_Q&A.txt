Q. What is the difference between Differential and Incremental Backup?
A. Differential Backup
It backs up only those files that have changed since the last full backup.
Suppose you have 5 files of 40 MB that you took the backup of on Monday. On Tuesday you change two lines in one file. The differential backup will take the backup of the entire file in which changes were made which will be 40 MB.
These are faster and more flexible than a full backup.
You can run them once every day till the full backup.
Incremental Backup
They backup the data that has changed since the last backup, be it full or incremental.
In the same scenario, the incremental backup will only backup the data corresponding to those two lines. So, the total backup size will be in bytes
These are faster than differential backup and are much smaller as well.
They are so small, you can run them almost every hour.

Q. Are you familiar with the Syswow64 folder?
